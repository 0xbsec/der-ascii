# DER ASCII Language Specification.

# This specification is a valid DER ASCII file.


# A DER ASCII file is a sequence of tokens. Most tokens resolve to a byte
# string which is emitted as soon as it is processed.

# Tokens are separated by whitespace, which is defined to be space (0x20), TAB
# (0x09), CR (0x0d), and LF (0x0a). Apart from acting as a token separator,
# whitespace is not significant.

# Comments begin with # and run to the end of the line. Comments are treated as
# whitespace.


# Quoted strings.

"Quoted strings are delimited by double quotes. Backslash denotes escape
sequences. Legal escape sequences are: \\ \" \x00 \n. \x00 consumes two hex
digits and emits a byte. Otherwise, any byte before the closing quote,
including a newline, is emitted as-is."

# Tokens in the file are emitted one after another, so the following lines
# produce the same output:
"hello world"
"hello " "world"


# UTF-16 literals.

u"A quoted string beginning with 'u' is a UTF-16 literal. Uescaped
octets are interpreted as UTF-8 and then encoded as big-endian UTF-16. Legal escape
sequences are: \\ \" \n \x00 \u0000 \U00000000. The last three forms differ
only in the number of hex digests they consume. If the value is 0xffff or
below, it emits the value as a big-endian 16-bit integer. Otherwise, it emits
the big-endian UTF-16 encoding. (The two cases are identical except unpaired
high or low surrogates are legal.)"


# Hex literals.

# Backticks denote hex literals. Either uppercase or lowercase is legal, but no
# characters other than hexadecimal digits may appear. A hex literal emits the
# decoded byte string.
`00`
`abcdef`
`AbCdEf`


# Integers.

# Tokens which match /-?[0-9]+/ are integer tokens. They emit the contents of
# the value's DER encoding as an INTEGER. (Big-endian, base-256,
# two's-complement, and minimally-encoded.)
456


# Object identifiers.

# Tokens which match /[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)+/ are object identifier (OID) tokens.
# They emit the contents of the value's DER encoding as an OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
1.2.840.113554.4.1.72585


# Booleans.

# The following tokens emit `ff` and `00`, respectively.
TRUE
FALSE


# Tag expressions.

# Square brackets denote a tag expression, similar to ASN.1's syntax. Unlike
# ASN.1, the constructed bit is treated as part of the tag.
#
# A tag expression contains one to three components separated by space (0x20):
# an optional tag class, a decimal tag number, and an optional constructed bit.
# By default, tags have class context-specific and set the constructed bit.
# Alternatively, the first two components may be replaced by a type name (see
# below).
#
# A tag expression emits the tag portion of a DER element with the specified
# tag class, tag number, and constructed bit. Note that it does not emit an
# element body. Those are specified separatedly.
#
# Examples:
[0]
[0 PRIMITIVE]
[0 CONSTRUCTED] # This is equivalent to [0]
[APPLICATION 1]
[PRIVATE 2]
[UNIVERSAL 16] # This is a SEQUENCE.
[UNIVERSAL 2 PRIMITIVE] # This is an INTEGER.

# As a shorthand, one may write type names from ASN.1, replacing spaces with
# underscore. These specify tag, number, and the constructed bit. The
# constructed bit is set for SEQUENCE and SET and unset otherwise.
INTEGER
SEQUENCE
OCTET_STRING

# Within a tag expression, type names may also be used in place of the class
# and tag number. If unspecified, the constructed bit is CONSTRUCTED for
# SEQUENCE and SET and PRIMITIVE otherwise.
[SEQUENCE PRIMITIVE]
[OCTET_STRING CONSTRUCTED]
[INTEGER] # This is the same as INTEGER
[INTEGER PRIMITIVE] # This is the same as INTEGER


# Length prefixes.

# Matching curly brace tokens denote length prefixes. They emit a DER-encoded
# length prefix followed by the encoding of the brace contents.
#
# Tag expressions should always be followed by a length prefix to emit a valid
# DER element, but there is no requirement to do so. See below for examples of
# intentionally malformed test inputs where tags and length prefixes do not
# match.

# This is an OID.
OBJECT_IDENTIFIER { 1.2.840.113554.4.1.72585 }

# This is a NULL.
NULL {}

# This is a SEQUENCE of two INTEGERs.
SEQUENCE {
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { `00ff` }
}

# This is an explicitly-tagged SEQUENCE.
[0] {
  SEQUENCE {
    INTEGER { 1 }
    INTEGER { `00ff` }
  }
}

# Note that curly braces are not optional, even in explicit tagging. Thus this
# isn't the same thing, despite the similar ASN.1 syntax.
[0] SEQUENCE {
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { `00ff` }
}

# This is a BER constructed OCTET STRING.
[OCTET_STRING CONSTRUCTED] {
  OCTET_STRING { "hello " }
  OCTET_STRING { "world" }
}

# Implicit tagging is written without the underlying tag, as in the DER
# encoding. Note that the constructed bit must match the underlying tag for a
# correct encoding.
[0 PRIMITIVE] { 1 }  # [0] IMPLICIT INTEGER.
[0] {  # [0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF INTEGER.
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { `00ff` }
}


# Examples.

# These primitives may be combined with raw byte strings to produce other
# encodings.

# This is an indefinite-length SEQUENCE.
SEQUENCE `80`
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { 2 }
`0000`

# This is a SEQUENCE with the wrong constructed bit.
[SEQUENCE PRIMITIVE] {
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { 2 }
}

# This is a SEQUENCE with the tag incorrectly encoded in high tag number form.
`3f90` {
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { 2 }
}

# This is a SEQUENCE with garbage instead of the length.
SEQUENCE `aabbcc`
  INTEGER { 1 }
  INTEGER { 2 }


# Disassembler.

# Although the conversion from DER ASCII to a byte string is well-defined, the
# inverse is not. A given byte string may have multiple disassemblies. The
# disassembler heuristically attempts to give a useful conversion for its
# input.
#
# It is a goal that any valid BER or DER input will be decoded reasonably, along
# with common embeddings of encoded structures within OCTET STRINGs, etc.
# Invalid encodings, however, will likely disassemble to a hex literal and not
# be easily editable.
#
# The algorithm is as follows:
#
# 1. Raw byte strings are encoded heuristically as quoted strings or hex
#    literals depending on what fraction is printable ASCII.
#
# 2. Greedily parse BER elements out of the input. Indefinite-length encoding is
#    legal. On parse error, encode the remaining bytes as in step 1.
#
# 3. Minimally encode the tag in the BER element followed by the body in curly
#    braces. If the element is indefinite-length, emit `80` for { and `0000` for
#    }.
#
# 4. If the element has the constructed bit, recurse to encode the body.
#
# 5. Otherwise, heuristically encode the body based on the tag:
#
#    a. If the tag is INTEGER and the body is a valid integer under some
#       threshold, encode as an integer. Otherwise a hex literal.
#
#    b. If the tag is OBJECT IDENTIFIER and the body is a valid OID, encode as
#       an OID. Otherwise a hex literal.
#
#    c. If the tag is BOOLEAN and the body is valid, encode as TRUE or FALSE.
#       Otherwise a hex literal.
#
#    d. If the tag is BIT STRING and the body is non-empty, encode the first
#       byte as a separate hex literal. If this value is non-zero, encode the
#       remainder as a raw byte string. Otherwise, apply step e to encode body.
#       This is to account for X.509 incorrectly using BIT STRING instead of
#       OCTET STRING for SubjectPublicKeyInfo and signatures.
#
#    e. If the tag is BMPString, decode the body as UTF-16 and encode as a
#       UTF-16 literal. Unpaired surrogates and unprintable code points are
#       escaped. If there is a byte left over, encode it in an additional hex
#       literal.
#
#    f. Otherwise, if the body may be parsed as a series of BER elements without
#       trailing data, recurse into the body. If not, encode it as a raw byte
#       string.
